# Agave
Agave is a minimal kernel written in C from scratch for learning purposes.

It has a few features right now.

## Building
I have not tested the build process on anything other than my machine (Sillicon MacBook), but here is the command:
`scripts/build.sh`

Or to build & run:
`scripts/run.sh`
